# Worksheet 1

### 1. Use the iris data set. For each attribute, Do the following:
	- Find minimum, maximum, First Quartile, Second Quartile, Third quartile, Fourth quartile and Inter Quartile range for each class. Draw Box plot. 
	- Plot histogram for each class
	- Find mean, variance, standard deviation for each class.
	- Find covariance matrix for each class between all features.
	- Interpret the results and findings.

### 2.	Use the flights data set.
	- Print the structure of the data. What do you think about it?
	- Print the summary statistics of the data. What do you think about the values? (format, consistency, completeness)
	- Print the dimensionality of the data (number of rows and columns)
	- Print the number of rows, columns and the names of the variables.
	- Print whether the first column has missing values (NAs). Try to answer this question with two ways. Hint: %in%
	- Print the number of variables that contain missing values.
	- Find the portion of the variables that contain missing values. What do you think about it?
	- Print the names of the variables that contain missing values.

### 3.	Use the flight data set to compute the following:
	- Print the destination, the delay of arrivals and the air time of each flight. Hint: use select.
	- Print the columns that their name contains the word �Delay�.
	- Print the names of carrier, the month and the day of the week that the delay of carrier is higher than 180. 
	- Print out all the flights grouped by carrier names. 
	- Print out the mean of the arrival delay using the summarise function. 
	- Print out the minimum, mean, median, variance, standard deviation, maximum, and counts of AirTime. 
	- Print out the mean delay and the number of flights of each carrier. 
	- Print out the mean delay and the number of flights of each carrier in descending order. 
	- Create a new column code>Full_Date which will contain the date of each flight and then print it out. Hint: Use the mutate function.
	- Print out the dates that had the most flights and then print out the dates that had the highest ratio of cancelled flights.

### 4.	Use the flight data set install and load the packages stringr, chron.
	- Print the first five rows of the dataset. What do you think about the date formatting?
	- Create a new objected named dep_timeand assign the values of flights$DepTime . If the value is less than 4 elements, fill make it a 4-element value with zeros. For example, 123 -> 0123.
	- Create a new object named hour and assign the first two elements of the dep_time object. Can you figure out why I am asking that?
	- Create a new object named minutes and assign the last two elements of the dep_time object.
	- Assign to the object dep_time the hour in format �HH:MM:SS� , seconds should be �00� , we make this assumption for the sake of formatting.
	- Change the class of dep_time from character to times.
	- Print the first 10 rows and then the 10 last rows of the dep_time. If the formatting of the object is �HH:MM:SS�(as it should) then assign the dep_time to flights$DepTime .
	- Do the exact same process for the flights$DepTime and create the variable arr_time
	- Do the exact same process for the flights$ CRSDepTime and create the variable crs_dep_time
	- Do the exact same process for the flights$CRSArrTime and create the variable crs_arr_time.

### 5.	Use the flight data set
	- Print the summary statistics in order to have an actual idea of the missing values. 
	- Impute the missing values of flights$ArrTime with the mean using which. 
	- Impute the missing values of flights$CRSArrTime with the median using which. 
	- Impute the missing values of flights$AirTime with the median using transform. 
	- Impute the missing values of flights$DepTime with the median using transform. Note: mind the data formatting. 
	- Impute the missing values of flights$ArrDelay with the median using impute. 
	- Impute the missing values of flights$CRSElapsedTime with the median using impute. 
	- Make a linear regression model named lm_dep_time_delay with target variable flights$DepDelay and independent variables : flights$ArrTime, flights$AirTime, flights$ArrDelay, flights$DepTime.
	- Create an object pred_dep_time_delay and assign the predicted values. 
	- Impute the missing values based using the pred_dep_time_delay and ifelse function. Print the summary statistics to see the changes that you made.

### 6.	Use the flight data set to compute the following:
	- Print the summary statistics and the structure of the dataset in order to see the type of variables and their extreme values, whether it makes sense or not. 
	- When it comes to categorical variables, outliers are considered to be the values of which frequency is less than 1% , barplot of flights$UniqueCarrier and flights$CancellationCode. What do you think? Try for other categorical variables also.
	- Remove the outliers that you have noticed at the barplots of the previous exercise, consider the function subset. 
	- A good way of detecting outliers from numerical variables is boxplot, make one with flights$ActualElapsedTime. 
	- Remove the outliers of flights$ActualElapsedTime using boxplot.stats. 
	- Remove outliers from flights using the subset function ,where TaxiIn > 0 and < 120. 
	- Remove outliers from flights using the subset function ,where TaxiOut > 0 and < 50. 
	- Assign NA value if the value is an outlier of flights$ArrDelay using the ifelse function. 
	- Use the rp.outlier to detect and remove the outliers using the Lund Test from flights$Distance , use the rapportools. 
	- Find the 2% most extreme values of flights$CRSElapsedTime using the scores with chi-square method.
